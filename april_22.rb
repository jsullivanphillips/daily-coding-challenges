# ---- PROBLEM ----- #
# Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer 
# in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer
# that does not exist in the input array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

# For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.

# You can modify the input array in-place

# test cases are in april_22_test.rb

# Assumptions: its not about a pattern. its
